# Deploy Impact OpenEdu B

This is a repo for the OpenEdu B Team, sponsered by women++ to focus on a given challenge. Here, we were given to design a new solution for users to navigate the wiki universe. In particular, we were asked to deliver a prototype of a solution, with a backend, a new design for the frontend, data science modules and most importantly, an ontology.

The folders are separated into 3 folders:

- `src`: Location of all code, along with any parsable files 
- `docs`: Location of all documentation regarding the project
- `test`: Any test files that we have produced. 

These three folders are then sub-divided into different modules, which include `backend`, `data-science`, `frontend`, `presentation` and `ux-ui`, depending on the presence of relevant files.
